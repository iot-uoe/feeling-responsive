The [IoT Challenge]( {{ site.url }}/iotchallenge) was a 5-day student hackathon, modelled loosely on the School of Informatics [Smart Data Hack](http://smartdatahack.org), that took advantage of the break in teaching offered by 2017's [Festival of Creative Learning](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk). The first couple of days were devoted to getting the basics in place for participants: hearing the challenges, forming teams, getting everyone registered on [Slack](https://slack.com), learning how to use LoPy devices, how to capture data from sensors and how to send data across the LoRaWAN network to the [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org) server.
