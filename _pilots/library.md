This pilot explored using chair sensor kits (similar to those described in the [Argyle House pilot]({{ site.url }}/pilots/argyle_house)) to determine occupancy levels of the University's Main Library. One goal of this work was to make real-time information about occupancy available to students *via* a display screen in the library foyer or via an app. 

We are currently reviewing additional routes to assessing occupancy levels in this building.
