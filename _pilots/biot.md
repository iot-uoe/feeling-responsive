This project explores, identifies, and demonstrates the potential of distributed ledgers in general &mdash; and blockchain technology in particular &mdash; in IoT-enabled Intelligent Transportation Systems. The project involves four academic partners (Imperial College London, University of Surrey, University of Warwick, University of Edinburgh) and five commercial partners, with close collaboration to create synergistic effects and broad impact. 

Working in collaboration with [Wallet.Services](https://www.wallet.services), the Edinburgh academic team will focus on **Location aware smart contracts**, addressing questions such as:

* If things can prove where they are, what kinds of interactions can we design and carry out?
* What specific properties do we want to prove?
* How do we verify location properties?

B-IoT has been funded by [PETRAS](https://www.petrashub.org).
