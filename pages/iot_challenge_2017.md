The **IoT Challenge** is a 5-day hackathon (20&ndash;24 February 2017) during the University of Edinburgh's [Festival of Creative Learning](http://www.festivalofcreativelearning.ed.ac.uk) which will bring students and researchers together to build tools and applications using Internet of Things technology.

The University is [establishing a pilot IoT network using LoRaWAN technology]({{ site.url }}/development). The network will allow multiple devices and sensors to send data to a backend server which can then feed this information into user-facing applications and services. The network and a pool of devices + sensors will be made available to you as one of the first sets of early-adopters. We are encouraging multi-disciplinary teams with a mix of skills in design, business, hardware / software engineering and data science to develop exciting new products and services!

The IoT Challenge is hosted by the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/) in partnership with [Information Services](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services).
<!-- , [The School of Social and Political Sciences](http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk), [The Global Development Academy](http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/global-development)  
and [Edinburgh Living Lab](hgttp://edinburghlivinglab.org)
-->
Following the pattern of the very sucessful [Smart Data Hack](http://smartdatahack.org), we will be working with a number of organisations to provide challenges and prizes.

## When and where?

It's happening  Monday 20th &ndash; Friday 25th February 2017. The first day will be held in the Informatics Forum (TBC), then over the next four days practical work with IoT devices will take place in the [uCreate Studio Makerspace](http://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/supporting-learning-and-teaching/ucreatestudio), Room 1.12 Main Library.
