We are in the process of installing [Kerlink](http://www.kerlink.fr/en/) gateways at up to five sites across the University campus. In the first instance, data sent to the gateways will be accessed via [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org).

The first of these gateways was installed on the library at Kings Buildings at the start of December 2016, and a second one is in the process of being set up on the roof of 50 George Square. Additional gateways are being temporarily deployed inside Argyle House and the University Main Library.
