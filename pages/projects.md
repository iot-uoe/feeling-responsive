In order to explore and demonstrate the potential of our IoT network, we are encouraging different teams from across the University of Edinburgh to experiment with different ways of using our infrastructure.  In addition, we are involved in externally-funded projects which will explore and possible extend the infrastructure.

If you would like to find out more about these projects, or if you have a project that you would like to propose (within or beyond the University), please [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact/).

The following projects are currently underway:
