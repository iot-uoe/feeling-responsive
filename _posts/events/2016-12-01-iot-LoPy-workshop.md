Come join us for the follow-up to our previous and very popular Design Informatics hosted Pycom LoPy LoRaWAN workshop in October.

We'll be working once again with Pycom LoPys, but this time with more emphasis on LoPy to LoPy inter-communications wth LoRa and connecting up a wider array of sensors.

We'll be in the new UCreate Studio at the Main Library (room 1.12), which has been created as a dedicated workshop space for all kinds of maker activities, so we'll have pretty much everything we need.

**The event is open to both staff and students, but we are limited to 20 people in total for this event so please [book early](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/iot-lopy-workshop-tickets-29644817447). Some familiarity with Python programming will be useful.**

All you need to do is bring your own laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux), and it would be helpful if you could pre-install the latest Pycom IDE, Pymakr, from [this link](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/pymakr/).

Please note that Pymakr has been upgraded significantly since the October workshop.
